Making secure calls to our REST API requires authentication and authorization. THEOlive makes use of token-secret pairs to authorize requests.

## 1. Getting a token-secret pair

To generate a token-secret pair, you should be registered for an account at on our [management console](https://console.theo.live/). Under the section "Tokens", click on the "Generate Token" button, and enter a name before clicking "Generate".

This will give a pop-up which shows your token "key" and the corresponding secret.

Once you "Close" the pop-up window, the new token will be visible in your list of tokens.

> ðŸš§ Please store the secret
>
> Make sure to store the secret somewhere, as this will be shown to you only once, and THEOlive only stores a hash of the secret, so it cannot be recovered afterward.

In case you forgot your secret, or the secret got exposed, you can easily regenerate a pair at all times.

## 2. Using the token-secret pair with Basic Authentication

THEOlive makes use of Basic Authentication when making requests to the API. In the 'Authorization' header, make sure to pass your token-secret pair (encrypted with base64), prepended with the word 'Basic'.

As an example, assume that your token has the value "my-token", and your secret has the value "my-secret". Then you can put them together like this: `my-token:my-secret`.

You subsequently encode this value using base64. Applying 'base64(my-token:my-secret)' will result in the following encoded string: 'bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0'

This string can then be used in combination with 'Basic' to pass in the 'Authorization' header:

```text
Authorization: Basic bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0
```

You can now make requests to our THEOlive API in the name of your organization!
