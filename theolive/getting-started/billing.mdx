---

This guide describes which payment methods are available, how to activate these, and when you will be billed.

## 1. Know this first

- You can test for free in demo mode. This limits your streaming time to 5 minutes and puts a watermark on your video. All other functionalities are equivalent to those available in production.
- When adding your payment method, you get $20 in production for free.
- We work with billing cycles and payment thresholds, in combination.

## 2. Add you billing details

Your billing details can be added via _My Account_ > _Billing Details_.
