# Authorization

Making secure calls to our REST API requires authentication and authorization. THEOlive makes use of token-secret pairs to authorize requests.

## 1. Getting a token-secret pair

To generate a token-secret pair, you should be registered for an account at on our [management console](https://console.theo.live/). Under the section "Tokens", click on the "Generate Token" button, and enter a name before clicking "Generate".

This will give a pop-up which shows your token "key" and the corresponding secret.

:::warning[Please store the secret]

Make sure to store the secret somewhere, as this will be shown to you only once, and THEOlive only stores a hash of the secret, so it cannot be recovered afterward.

:::

Once you "Close" the pop-up window, the new token will be visible in your list of tokens.

In case you forgot your secret, or the secret got exposed, you can easily regenerate a pair at all times.

## 2. Using the token-secret pair with Basic Authentication

THEOlive makes use of Basic Authentication when making requests to the API. In the 'Authorization' header, make sure to pass your token-secret pair (encoded with base64), prepended with the word 'Basic'.

For example, assume the token has value `my-token` and the secret has value `my-secret`: 1. Combine them like this: `my-token:my-secret`. 2. Encode this value using base64: `bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0` 3. Pass the full Authorization header (with `Basic` included) in your REST calls: `Authorization: Basic bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0`

So to summarize, the final header would be:

```text
Authorization: Basic bXktdG9rZW46bXktc2VjcmV0
```

You can now make authenticated requests to our THEOlive API.
