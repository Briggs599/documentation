# Overview

Using the embed version is ideal to get started quickly. However, it does not provide an API so for more advanced use cases we provide a javascript API which is available through npm.

From version v2.0.0 on this player supports:

- Player without a UI.
- Smooth zapping functionality between different THEOlive channels.
