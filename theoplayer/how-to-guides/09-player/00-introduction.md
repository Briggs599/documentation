# Introduction

The Player API is the top-level API. This API exposes:

- basic functions to manipulate video playback, such as start and pause;
- properties to check states and values, such as the playhead position;
- events to track changes.

The list below overviews how-to articles related to the Player API.

## Events

As a developer, you can programmatically attach event listeners to different APIs.
Event listeners are often used to [implement a custom UI](../../how-to-guides/11-ui/06-how-to-build-chromeless-ui.md) or
to [implement a custom analytics integration](../../how-to-guides/02-analytics/06-custom-analytics-integration.md).

The THEOplayer API exposes many events across different interfaces, as can be seen in the graphic below.
Furthermore, most events exist in all SDKs (Web, iOS-based, Android-based and Roku).

The table below gives an overview of a subset of the available events per interface in the THEOplayer Web SDK.
